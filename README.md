# Dramatic Lights
A lighting effect shader for [Canvas](https://github.com/grondag/canvas) renderer (a fabric minecraft mod).

## Features
1. Dawn and dusk "twilight" efect.
2. Directional sunlight on blocks (and entities with experimental pipeline enabled).
3. Ambient light - light blue during the day and dark blue during the night.
4. Hazy effect on block-lit indoor objects.

Current version is made to work with Canvas 1.0.1027.

For testing only, but you can play normally with it if you know what you're doing.
